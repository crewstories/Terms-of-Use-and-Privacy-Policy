Terms of Service

Effective: July 18th, 2016

These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern our relationship with you. Although we have tried our best to strip the “legalese” from the Terms, there are places where these Terms may still read like a traditional contract. This is because these Terms do indeed form a legally binding contract between you and Views, which is owned and operated by Crew Media, Inc (“Crew”). These terms govern your access to and use of the Views services (“Services”), including our Views mobile applications (“Views”), our websites and social channels, including the website located at theviewsapp.com (collectively the “Services” or “Views”), and any photos, videos, information, text, graphics, photos or other materials uploaded, downloaded or appearing on the Services (collectively referred to as “Content”). Your access to and use of the Services is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. By accessing or using the Services you agree to be bound by these Terms.

Please read the Terms carefully.

We will refer to all of our products and services as the "Services”.

By using the Services, you agree to the Terms. If you do not agree with the Terms, then do not use the Services.

(1) Who Can Use the Services

No one under 13 is allowed to create an account or use the Services. We may offer additional Services with additional terms that may require you to be even older to use them. If you are
under 18 years of age, you should review the Terms with your parent or guardian and ensure that you both understand it.

By using the Services, you state that:

•You can form a binding contract with Crew Media Inc.;

•You are not a person who is barred from receiving the Services under the laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction–meaning that you do not appear on the U.S. Treasury Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals or face any other similar prohibition; and

•You will comply with these Terms and all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules, and regulations.
If you are using the Services on behalf of a business or some other entity, you state that you are authorized to grant all licenses set forth in these Terms and to agree to these Terms on behalf of the business or entity.

(2) Basic Terms

You are responsible for your use of the Services, for any Content you post to the Services, and for any consequences thereof. The Content you submit, post, or display will be able to be viewed by other users of the Services and through third party services and websites. You should only provide Content that you are comfortable sharing with others under these Terms.

The Services that Views provides are always evolving and the form and nature of the Services may change from time to time without prior notice to you. In addition, Views may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing the Services (or any features within the Services) to you or to users generally and may not be able to provide you with prior notice. We also retain the right to create limits on use and storage at our sole discretion at any time without prior notice to you.

(3) Privacy

Any information that you provide to Views is subject to our Privacy Policy, which governs our collection and use of your information. You can learn how we handle your information when you use our Services by reading our privacy policy. We strongly encourage you to read the privacy policy because, by using our Services, you agree that Views can collect, use, and transfer your information consistent with that policy.

Also, as part of providing you the Services, we may need to provide you with certain communications, such as service announcements and administrative messages. These communications are considered part of the Services and your account, which you may not be able to opt-out from receiving.

(4) Your Account 

You are responsible for safeguarding the password or credentials that you use to access the Services and for any activities or actions under your account. We encourage you to use “strong” passwords (passwords that use a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers and symbols) with your account. Views cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with the above requirements.

You are responsible for any activity that occurs in your account. It's important that you keep your account secure. One way to do that is to select a strong password that you don't use for any other account.
By using the Services, you agree that, in addition to exercising common sense:

• You will not create more than one account for yourself.

• You will not create another account if we have already disabled your account, unless you have our written permission to do so.

• You will not buy, sell, rent, or lease access to your Views account or Views username without our written permission.

• You will not share your password.

• You will not log in or attempt to access the Services through unauthorized third-party applications or clients.

If you think that someone has gained access to your account, please immediately reach out to contact@theviewsapp.com.

(5) Your License To Use The Services

Views gives you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive license to use the software that is provided to you by Views as part of the Services. This license is for the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Services as provided by Views, in the manner permitted by these Terms.

Any software that we provide you may automatically download and install upgrades, updates, or other new features. You may be able to adjust these automatic downloads through your device's settings.

(6) Content On the Services

All Content, whether publicly posted or privately transmitted, is the sole responsibility of the person who originated such Content. We may, but are not required to monitor or control the Content posted via the Services and we cannot take responsibility for such Content. Any use or reliance on any Content or materials posted via the Services or obtained by you through the Services is at your own risk.

You agree not to post User Content that: (1) may create a risk of harm, loss, physical or mental injury, emotional distress, death, disability, disfigurement, or physical or mental illness to you, to any other person, or to any animal; (2) may create a risk of any other loss or damage to any person or property

We do not endorse, support, represent or guarantee the completeness, truthfulness, accuracy, or reliability of any Content or communications posted via the Services or endorse any opinions expressed via the Services. You understand that by using the Services, you may be exposed to Content that might be offensive, harmful, inaccurate or otherwise inappropriate, or in some cases, postings that have been mislabeled or are otherwise deceptive. Under no circumstances will Views be liable in any way for any Content, including, but not limited to, any errors or omissions in any Content, or any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of any Content posted, emailed, transmitted or otherwise made available via the Services or broadcast elsewhere.

We may offer you the opportunity to invite your friends or contacts to view your content or otherwise enjoy the Services. If you choose to invite one or more of your friends or contacts using text messaging (SMS), we may suggest content for the message. You may be able to edit that suggested content, and if you choose to send text message invitations, those messages will be sent from the native SMS application on your device. If you do choose to send such invitations, you represent to Views that the recipients of such invitations have consented to receive such messages from you, and that those recipients do not consider such messages unwanted or unsolicited.

(7) The Content of Others

Much of the content on our Services is produced by users, publishers, and other third parties. Whether that content is posted publicly or privately, the content is the sole responsibility of the person or organization that submitted it. Although Views reserves the right to review all content that appears on the 
Services and to remove any content that violates these Terms, we do not necessarily review all of it. So we cannot—and do not—take responsibility for any content that others provide through the Services.

Through these Terms, we make clear that we do not want the Services put to bad uses. But because we do not review all content, we cannot guarantee that content on the Services will always conform to our Terms or Guidelines.

(8) Rights in Content Granted to Views

By posting any User Content on the Service, you grant Views a worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable, and transferable license to host, store, use, display, reproduce, modify, adapt, edit, publish, and distribute that content. This license is for the limited purpose of operating, developing, providing, promoting, and improving the Services and researching and developing new ones.

While we're not required to do so, we may access, review, screen, and delete your content at any time and for any reason, in our sole discretion, including if we think your content violates these Terms. You alone though remain responsible for the content you create, upload, post, send, or store through the Service.

(9) Restrictions On Content And Use Of The Services

We reserve the right at all times (but will not have an obligation) to remove or refuse to distribute any Content on the Services and to suspend and or terminate users or reclaim usernames without liability to you.

You may NOT post Content that:

(1) may create a risk of harm, loss, physical or mental injury, emotional distress, death, disability, disfigurement, or physical or mental illness to you, to any other person, or to any animal; (2) may create a risk of any other loss or damage to any person or property; (3) seeks to harm or exploit children by exposing them to inappropriate content, asking for personally identifiable details or otherwise; (4) may constitute or contribute to a crime or tort; (5) 
contains any information or content that we deem to be unlawful, harmful, abusive, racially or ethnically offensive, defamatory, infringing, invasive of personal privacy or publicity rights, harassing, humiliating to other people (publicly or otherwise), libelous, threatening, profane, or otherwise objectionable; (6) contains any information or content that is illegal (including, without limitation, the disclosure of insider information under securities law or of another party’s trade secrets); (7) contains any information or content that you do not have a right to make available under any law or under contractual or fiduciary relationships; or (8) contains any information or content that you know is not correct and current. 
(10) Respecting Copy Rights

Views respects the requirements set forth in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. We therefore take reasonable steps to expeditiously remove from our Services any infringing material that we become aware of. If Views becomes aware that one of its users has repeatedly infringed copyrights, we will take reasonable steps within our power to terminate the user's account.

If you believe that anything on the Services infringes a copyright that you own or control, you may file a notice with our designated agent:

Ian Schwartz, Park West Finance Station P.O. Box 20029, New York, NY 10025, email: contact@theviewsapp.com

If you file a notice with our Copyright Agent, it must comply with the requirements set forth at 17 U.S.C. § 512(c)(3). That means the notice must:

• contain the physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner;

• identify the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed;

• identify the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed, or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to let us locate the material;

• provide your contact information, including your address, telephone number, and an email address;

• provide a personal statement that you have a good-faith belief that the use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and

• provide a statement that the information in the notification is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.

(11) Safety

We try hard to keep our Services a safe place for all users. By using the Services, you agree that:

• You will not use the Services for any purpose that is illegal or prohibited in these Terms.

• You will not use any robot, spider, crawler, scraper, or other automated means or interface to access the Services or extract 
other user's information.

• You will not use or develop any third-party applications that interact with the Services or other users' content or information without our written consent.

• You will not use the Services in a way that could interfere with, disrupt, negatively affect, or inhibit other users from fully enjoying the Services, or that could damage, disable, overburden, or impair the functioning of the Services.

• You will not use or attempt to use another user's account, username, or password without their permission.

• You will not solicit login credentials from another user.

• You will not post content that contains pornography, graphic violence, threats, hate speech, or incitements to violence.

• You will not upload viruses or other malicious code or otherwise compromise the security of the Services.

• You will not attempt to circumvent any content-filtering techniques we employ, or attempt to access areas or features of the Services that you are not authorized to access.
• You will not probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of our Services or any system or network.

• You will not encourage or promote any activity that violates these Terms.

We also care about your safety while using our Services. Do not use our Services in a way that would distract you from obeying traffic or safety laws. And never put yourself or others in harm's way just to capture or share a picture.

(12) Intellectual Property Rights

Except for your User Content, the Service and all materials therein or transferred thereby, including, without limitation, software, images, text, graphics, illustrations, logos, patents, trademarks, service marks, designs, scripts, copyrights, photographs, videos, trade dress are are exclusive intellectual property and trade dress owned by Crew Media Inc. 

Views registered trademarks and trade dress may not be used in connection with any product or service without the prior written consent of Crew Media Inc. 

You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of our Services, nor may you reverse engineer or attempt to extract the source code of that software, unless applicable laws prohibit these restrictions or you have our written permission to do so.

You may not copy, archive, download, upload, distribute, syndicate, broadcast, perform, display, make available, or otherwise use any portion of the Services or the content on the Services except as set forth in these Terms;

(13) Data Charges and Mobile Phones

You are responsible for any mobile charges that you may incur for using our Services, including text-messaging and data charges. If you're unsure what those charges may be, you should ask your service provider before using the Services.
If you change or deactivate the mobile phone number that you used to create a Views account, you must update your account information through Settings within 72 hours to prevent us from 
sending to someone else messages intended for you.

(14) Third-Party Services

If you use a service, feature, or functionality that is operated by a third party and made available through our Services (including Services we jointly offer with the third party), each party's terms will govern the respective party's relationship with you. Views is not responsible or liable for those third party's terms or actions taken under the third party's terms.

(15) Modifying the Services and Termination

We're always improving our Services and creating new ones all the time. That means we may add or remove features, products, or functionalities, and we may also suspend or stop the Services altogether. We may take any of these actions at any time, and when we do, we may not provide you with any notice beforehand.

You can terminate these Terms at any time and for any reason by deleting your account.

Views may also terminate these Terms with you at any time, for any reason, at our sole discretion, and without advanced notice. That means that we may stop providing you with any Services, or impose new or additional limits on your ability to use the Services. For example, we may deactivate your account due to prolonged inactivity, and we may reclaim your username at any time for any reason.

Regardless of who terminates these Terms, both you and Views continue to be bound by these Terms.

(16) Indemnity

You agree, to the extent permitted under applicable law, to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Views, our directors, officers, employees, and affiliates from and against any and all complaints, charges, claims, damages, losses, costs, liabilities, and expenses (including attorneys' fees) due to, arising out of, or relating in any way to: (a) your access to or use of the Services; (b) your content; and (c) your breach of these Terms.

(17) Disclaimers

We try to keep the Services up and running and free of annoyances. But we make no promises that we will succeed.
THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. IN ADDITION, WHILE VIEWS ATTEMPTS TO PROVIDE A GOOD USER EXPERIENCE, WE DO NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT: (A) THE SERVICES WILL ALWAYS BE SECURE, ERROR-FREE, OR TIMELY; (B) THE SERVICES WILL ALWAYS FUNCTION WITHOUT DELAYS, DISRUPTIONS, OR IMPERFECTIONS; OR (C) THAT ANY VIEWS CONTENT, USER CONTENT, OR INFORMATION YOU OBTAIN ON OR THROUGH THE SERVICES WILL BE TIMELY OR ACCURATE.
VIEWS TAKES NO RESPONSIBILITY AND ASSUMES NO LIABILITY FOR ANY CONTENT THAT YOU, ANOTHER USER, OR A THIRD PARTY CREATES, UPLOADS, POSTS, SENDS, RECEIVES, OR STORES ON OR THROUGH OUR SERVICES. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU MAY BE EXPOSED TO CONTENT THAT MIGHT BE OFFENSIVE, ILLEGAL, MISLEADING, OR OTHERWISE INAPPROPRIATE, NONE OF WHICH VIEWS WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR.

(18) Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, VIEWS AND OUR MANAGING MEMBERS, SHAREHOLDERS, EMPLOYEES, AFFILIATES, LICENSORS, AND SUPPLIERS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, OR MULTIPLE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM: (A) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES; (B) THE CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF OTHER USERS OR THIRD PARTIES ON OR THROUGH THE SERVICES; OR (C) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE, OR ALTERATION OF YOUR CONTENT, EVEN IF VIEWS HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT WILL VIEWS’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE SERVICES EXCEED THE GREATER OF $100 USD OR THE AMOUNT YOU PAID VIEWS, IF ANY, IN THE LAST 12 MONTHS.
SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES, SO SOME OR ALL OF THE EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

(19) Arbitration, Class Waiver, and Jury Waiver
PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS CAREFULLY BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES WITH VIEWS, AND LIMIT THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US.

a Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. All claims and disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms or the use of the Services that cannot be resolved in small claims court will be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis, except that you and Views are not required to arbitrate any dispute in which either party seeks equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets, or patents.

b Arbitration Rules. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this dispute-resolution provision. Arbitration will be initiated through the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"). If the AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. The rules of the arbitral forum will govern all aspects of this arbitration, except to the extent those rules conflict with these Terms. The AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules governing the arbitration are available online at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The arbitration will be conducted by a single neutral arbitrator. Any claims or disputes where the total amount sought is less than $10,000 USD may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. For claims or disputes where the total amount sought is $10,000 USD or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the arbitral forum's rules. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

c Additional Rules for Non-appearance Arbitration. If non-appearance arbitration is elected, the arbitration will be conducted by telephone, online, written submissions, or any combination of the three; the specific manner will be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration. The arbitration will not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless the parties mutually agree otherwise.

d Authority of the Arbitrator. The arbitrator will decide the jurisdiction of the arbitrator and the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Views. The dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim or dispute. The arbitrator will have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum's rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator will issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and Views.

e Waiver of Jury Trial. YOU AND VIEWS WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and VIEWS are instead electing to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient, and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In any litigation between you and VIEWS over whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration award, YOU AND VIEWS WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, and elect instead to have the dispute be resolved by a judge.

f Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS. CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. If, however, this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor we are entitled to arbitration; instead all claims and disputes will be resolved in a court as set forth in Section 18.

g Confidentiality. No part of the procedures will be open to the public or the media. All evidence discovered or submitted at the hearing is confidential and may not be disclosed, except by written agreement of the parties, pursuant to court order, or unless required by law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no party will be prevented from submitting to a court of law any information needed to enforce this arbitration agreement, to enforce an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief.

h Right to Waive. Any rights and limitations set forth in this arbitration agreement may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted. Such waiver will not waive or affect any other portion of this arbitration agreement.

i Opt-out. You may opt out of this arbitration agreement. If you do so, neither you nor Views can force the other to arbitrate. To opt out, you must notify Views in writing no later than 30 days after first becoming subject to this arbitration agreement. Your notice must include your name and address, your Views username and the email address you used to set up your Views account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt-out of this arbitration agreement. You must send your opt-out notice to this address: Crew Media, Inc., ATTN: Arbitration Opt-out, Park West Finance Station P.O. Box 20029, New York, NY 10025.

j Small Claims Court. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or Views may bring an individual action in small claims court.

k Arbitration Agreement Survival. This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Views.

(20) Exclusive Venue To the extent the parties are permitted under these Terms to initiate litigation in a court, both you and Views agree that all claims and disputes arising out of or relating to the Terms or the use of the Services will be litigated exclusively in a United States District Court of New York.

(21) Choice of Law Except to the extent they are preempted by U.S. federal law, the laws of New York, other than its conflict-of-laws principles, govern these Terms and any disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms or their subject matter, including tort claims.

(22) Severability
If any provision of these Terms is found unenforceable, then that provision will be severed from these Terms and not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.

(23) Additional Terms for Specific Services Given the breadth of our Services, we sometimes need to craft additional terms and conditions for specific Services. Those additional terms and conditions, which will be available with the relevant Services, then become part of your agreement with us if you use those Services.

(24) Final Terms

• These Terms make up the entire agreement between you and Views, and supersede any prior agreements.

• These Terms do no create or confer any third-party beneficiary rights.

• If we do not enforce a provision in these Terms, it will not be considered a waiver.

• We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.

• You may not transfer any of your rights or obligations under these Terms without our consent

• These Terms were written in English and to the extent the translated version of these Terms conflict with the English version, the English version will control.
