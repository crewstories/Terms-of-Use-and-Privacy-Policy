Privacy Policy

Last Modified: July 15th, 2016

Welcome to the Views App! ("Views," "we," "us" or "our"). Views provides a fast, simple way to create photo & video albums with a group of people. 

Below is our privacy policy that governs your use of the Views (collectively, the “Service”) for mobile devices that was created by Crew Media, Inc.

By using our Service you understand and agree that we are providing a platform for you to post content, including photos, videos and other materials ("User Content"), to the Service and to share User Content with others who access the Service ("Users").

When you use views services, you’ll inevitably share some information with us. That’s why we’ve written this privacy policy. This policy covers the information we collect, how we use it, whom we share it with, and the choices we give you to control, access, and update your information. If you still have questions about anything in our privacy policy, please contact us at contact@theviewsapp.com.

	Information We Collect

There are three basic ways we collect information:

•	Information you choose to give us.
•	Information we get when you use our services.
•	Information we get from third parties.

Here’s a little more detail on each of these categories.

Information You Choose to Give Us

When you interact with our services, we collect the information that you choose to share with us. For example, most of our services require you to set up a basic Views account, so we need to collect a few important details about you, such as: your name, a unique username you’d like to go by, a password, an email address, a phone number and your date of birth. To make it easier for others to find you, we may also ask you to provide us with some additional information that will be publicly visible on our services such as profile pictures, a name, a username, or other useful identifying information. 

Of course, you’ll also provide us whatever information you send through the services, such as photos, videos and comments to other users on the service. Keep in mind that the users you send photos, videos or comments, and any other content to can always save that content or copy it outside the app. Don’t send messages or share content that you wouldn’t want someone to save or share.

When you contact Views Support or communicate with us in any other way, we’ll collect whatever information you volunteer.

Information We Get When You Use Our Services

When you use our services, we collect information about which of those services you’ve used and how you’ve used them. Here’s a fuller explanation of the types of information we collect when you use our services:
•	
•	Usage Information. We collect information about your activity through our 
services. For example, we may collect information about:
			
o	how you interact with the services or which search queries you submit.
		
o	how you communicate with other views members, such as their names, the time and date of your communications, the number of photos and videos you exchange with your friends, which friends you exchange photos and videos with the most, and your interactions with photos and videos (such as when you open a message or capture a screenshot).

•	Content Information. We collect information about the content you provide, 
such as if the recipient has viewed the content, replayed the content, and the metadata that is provided with the content.

•	Device Information. We collect device-specific information, such as the
hardware model, operating system version, advertising identifier, unique application identifiers, unique device identifiers, browser type, language, wireless network, and mobile network information (including the mobile phone number).

•	Device Phonebook. Because Views is all about communicating with friends,
We may—with your consent—collect information from your device’s phonebook.

•	Camera and Photos. Many of our services require us to collect images and 
other information from your device’s camera and photos. We’ll access your camera and photos only after you give us your consent.

•	Location Information. When you use our services we may collect information
about your location. With your consent, we may also collect information about your precise location using methods that include GPS, wireless networks, cell
towers, Wi-Fi access points, and other sensors, such as gyroscopes, accelerometers, and compasses.

•	Information Collected by Cookies and Other Technologies. Like most online
services and mobile applications, we may use cookies and other technologies, such as web beacons, web storage, and unique advertising identifiers, to collect information about your activity, browser, and device. We may also use these technologies to collect information when you interact with services we offer through one of our partners, such as commerce features. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually remove or reject browser cookies through the settings on your browser or device. Keep in mind, though, that removing or rejecting cookies could affect the availability and functionality of our services. 

•	Log Information. We also collect log information when you use our website.
That information includes, among other things:
			
o	details about how you’ve used our services

o	device information, such as your web browser type and language	

o	access times

o	pages viewed

o	IP address

o	identifiers associated with cookies or other technologies that may uniquely

o	identify your device or browser

o	pages you visited before or after navigating to our website.
	
Information We Collect from Third Parties

We may collect information that other users provide about you when they use our services. For example, if another user allows us to collect information from their device phonebook—and you’re one of that user’s contacts—we may combine the information we collect from that user’s phonebook with other information we have collected about you. We may also obtain information from other companies that are owned or operated by us, or any other third-party sources, and combine that with the information we collect through our services.

How We Use Information

What do we do with the information we collect? The short answer is: Provide you with an amazing set of products and services that we relentlessly improve. But we do a lot more as well, such as:
			
•	develop, operate, improve, deliver, maintain, and protect our products and services

•	communicate with you

•	monitor and analyze trends and usage

•	personalize the services by, among other things, suggesting friends or profile

•	information, or customizing the content we show you, including ads

•	enhance the safety and security of our products and services

•	verify your identity and prevent fraud or other unauthorized or illegal activity

•	use information we’ve collected from cookies and other technology to enhance

•	the services and your experience with them

•	enforce our Terms of Service and other usage polices

We may also store some information locally on your device. For example, we may store information as local cache so that you can open the app and view content faster.

How We Share Information

We may share information about you in the following ways:
	
•	With other Views members. We may share the following information with other Views members:

•	information about you, such as your username and name;

•	information about how you have interacted with the services, the names of users and contacts in your phonebook, and other information that will help members understand your connections with others using the services. For example, because it may not be clear whether a new friend request comes from someone you actually know, we may share whether you and the requestor have Views friends in common;

•	any additional information you have consented for us to share. For example, when you let us access your device phonebook, we may share information about you with other users who have your phone number in their device phonebook; and

•	content you post or send will be shared with other Views members; how widely your content is shared depends on your personal settings and the type of service you are using.
	
•	With all Views members and the general public. We may share the following information with all Views members as well as the general public:

•	public information like your profile pictures; and

•	any content that you submit. If a service is streamed on the web or broadcast in some other media, it may be viewed by the public at large.

•	With our affiliates. We may share information with entities within the Views family of companies.

•	With third parties. We may share your information with the following third parties:

•	With service providers, sellers, and partners. We may share information about you with service providers who perform services on our behalf, sellers that provide goods through our services, and business partners that provide services and functionality.

•	With third parties for legal reasons. We may share information about you if we reasonably believe that disclosing the information is needed to:

•	comply with any valid legal process, government request, or applicable law, rule, or regulation;

•	investigate, remedy, or enforce potential Terms of Service violations;

•	protect the rights, property, and safety of us, our users, or others; or
•	detect and resolve any fraud or security concerns.

•	With third parties as part of a merger or acquisition. If Views gets involved in a merger, asset sale, financing, liquidation or bankruptcy, or acquisition of all or some portion of our business to another company, we may share your information with that company before and after the transaction closes.

•	In the aggregate or after de-identification. We may also share with third parties, such as advertisers, aggregated or de-identified information that cannot reasonably be used to identify you.
	
Information You Choose to Share with Third Parties

The services may also contain third-party links and search results, include third-party integrations, or be a co-branded or third-party-branded service that’s being provided jointly with or by another company. By going to those links, using the third-party integration, or using a co-branded or third-party-branded service, you may be providing information (including personal information) directly to the third party, us, or both. You acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for how those third parties collect or use your information. As always, we encourage you to review the privacy policies of every third-party website or service that you visit or use, including those third parties you interact with through our services.

How We Store your Information

Storage and Processing:
	
	Your information collected through the Service may be stored and processed in
	the United States or any other country in which Views, its Affiliates or Service
	Providers maintain facilities.
	
	By registering for and using the Service you consent to the transfer of
information to the U.S. or to any other country in which Views, its Affiliates or Service Providers maintain facilities and the use and disclosure of information about you as described in this Privacy Policy.
	
	We use commercially reasonable safeguards to help keep the information
	collected through the Service secure and take reasonable steps (such as
	requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you access
	to your account. However, Views cannot ensure the security of any
	information you transmit to Views or guarantee that information on the
	Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed.

Please do your part to help us. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information, and for controlling access to emails between you and Views, at all times. We are not responsible for the functionality, privacy, or security measures of any other organization.

You should understand that users who see the content you provide can always save it using any number of techniques: screenshots, in-app functionality, or any other image-capture technology. It’s also possible, as with any digital information, that someone might be able to access messages forensically or find them in a device’s temporary storage. We may also retain certain information in backup for a limited period of time or as required by law.
Control over Your Information

We want you to be in control of your information, so we provide you with the following tools.
			
	Access and Updates. We strive to let you access and update most of the
personal information that we have about you. There are limits though to the requests we’ll accommodate. We may reject a request for a number of reasons, including, for example, that the request risks the privacy of other users, requires technical efforts that are disproportionate to the request, is repetitive, or is unlawful. You can access and update most of your basic account information right visiting the app’s Settings page. If you need to access, update, or delete any other personal information that we may have, just contact us at contact@theviewsapp.com. Because your privacy is important to us, we may ask you to verify your identity or provide additional information before we let you access or update your personal information. We will try to update and access your information for free, but if it would require a disproportionate effort on our part, we may charge a fee. We will of course disclose the fee before we comply with your request.
			
Revoking Permissions. If you change your mind about our ongoing ability to collect information from certain sources that you have already consented to, such as your phonebook, camera, photos, or location services, you can simply revoke your consent by changing the settings on your device if your device offers those options. Of course, if you do that, certain services may lose full functionality.
	
	Account Deletion. While we hope you’ll remain a lifelong Views member, if for 
some reason you ever want to delete your account, just contact us at contact@theviewsapp.com. If you ask to delete your account, you will have up to 30 days to restore your account before we delete your information from our servers. During this period of time, your account will not be visible to other Views members.
	
Analytics and Advertising Services Provided by Others

We may let other companies use cookies, web beacons, and similar tracking technologies on the services. These companies may collect information about how you use the services and other websites and online services over time and across different services. This information may be used to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content, and better understand your online activity.

Additionally, some companies may use the information they collect on our services to deliver targeted advertisements on behalf of us or other companies, including on third-party websites and apps. Views does not currently respond to do-not-track signals that may be sent from your device. If we do so in the future, we will provide information about that practice in an updated version of this privacy policy. For more information about interest-based ads, including how to opt out of having your web-browsing information used for behavioral-advertising purposes, please visit www.aboutads.info/choices.

Users Outside the United States

Although we welcome Views members from all over the world, keep in mind that no matter where you live or where you happen to use our services, we operate our services from the United States. This means that we may collect your personal information from, transfer it to, and store and process it in the United States and other countries whose local data-protection and privacy laws may offer fewer protections than those in your country of residence or from any country where you use or access the services.


Children

Our services are not intended for—and we don’t direct them to—anyone under 13. And that’s why we do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under 13.

Revisions to the Privacy Policy

We may change this privacy policy from time to time. When we do, we’ll let you know one way or another. Sometimes, we’ll let you know by revising the date at the top of the privacy policy that’s available on our website and mobile application. Other times, we may provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our websites’ homepages or providing you with an in-app notification). Your continued use of Views or the Service after any modification to this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such modification.
